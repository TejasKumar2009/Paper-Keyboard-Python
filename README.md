# Paper-Keyboard-Python
This is a very unique python project in which a paper can act like a keyboard and clicks happens by detecting red dots.

This python program is created with the help of python opencv (Computer vision) in which the program detects
a red dot which will be present on the clip we will wear on our fingers to write in paper keyboard.
Moreover, different keys on the paper keyboard are recognised by relating the coordinates of the
paper and camera frame(NOTE : PHONE CAMERA IS USED IN THIS PROJECT) and different keys are clicked
by using the pyautogui module in python. We just have to keep our phone camera(IP WebCam connected to laptop)
in a way that it keeps whole keyboard in the picture and keep camera stable and just wear that red dot
ring and star writing. However. it is a little bit slow from standard keyboard. But it works perfectly !
